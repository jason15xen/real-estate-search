"""Resolve the place a query searched INSIDE to a row of the regions table.

Geo-location contract: /search returns regionId + canonical regionName + the
boundary ONLY when that region's polygon actually filtered the results
(resolve_search_region succeeded and the region has geometry). Every fallback —
no polygon data, subdivision/neighborhood searches, ambiguous names — returns
regionId null, with the parsed place name as a bare label. regionId is a promise
that the pins are that region's geometry; never a guess.
