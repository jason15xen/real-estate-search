    Three parts, all idempotent and cheap when there is nothing to do:
      1. DELETE properties whose OWN raw record is no longer FOR_SALE — a listing
         re-sent under the same GUID after it sold / went pending (children cascade).
      2. DELETE properties superseded by a NEWER raw record with the same zpid that is
         not FOR_SALE. The scraper re-issues GUIDs on re-scrape, so a status change
         usually arrives under a new GUID: it gets parked by part 3 and the old
         FOR_SALE row would otherwise stay searchable forever (1550 Mars St, 2026-08).
         "Newer" is decided by upload time, so an OLD pending record can never delete
         a listing that has since been re-listed and adopted under a new GUID.
      3. Park still-pending raw rows of non-FOR_SALE listings in a terminal status so
         the worker never claims them: no vision spend on homes we would delete anyway.
    A listing that returns to FOR_SALE is re-uploaded as 'unprocessed' by /process and
    flows through normally, so this never permanently blacklists a property.
